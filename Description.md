The fortran code simulates the synchronous rotation of titan and one can play around
with various parameters like eccentricity, rotation speed or mass to check how 
it influences the synchronous rotation of titan.

The pdf file attached more or less explains how the code works and which function 
does what along with the scientific explanation as well (Bold of me to assume it does).

If you find anything wrong or anyway of improving the code, do notify me
